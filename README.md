WarWalk is a generic war-driving app for the android platform. It gathers all public broadcast information and collates it in a sqlite3 database.
This software is a proof-of-concept and not intended for use in production systems.

This software does not capture any user data, only the details of the Wifi AP. Even so, residents of the United States may want to read this first.
